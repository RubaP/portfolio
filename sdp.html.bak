			<h3 class="mb-3 mt-5">1. Teaching and Learning</h3>
			Teaching and Learning category of this course covers range of aspects related to class room teaching from managing the students at the class to using technology effectively for delivery.
			
			<h4 class="mb-3 mt-5">Classroom Management</h4>
			This session was conducted on the very first day of the course by <a href="https://fapm.wyb.ac.lk/?page_id=1841">Prof. Udit Jayalath</a>. 
			Prof. Udith Jayasinghe is the Vice-Chancellor of the Wayamba University of Sri Lanka (WUSL). He serves as the Senior Professor and the Chair of Dept. of Agribusiness Management, Faculty of Agriculture & Plantation Management of WUSL.

                <h5>4H Model</h5>
                <p>The initial discussion was centered on understanding the 4H model that reflects four different categories of skills required for a teacher. The four important categories are head, heart, hand, and health, and they are further capitalized into a set of skills. It is very important that we focus on improving all four skills and lacking one skill would result in poor quality in the delivery as all four groups of skills are interrelated.

                <h5>Managing Different Types of Students</h5>
                <p>Similar to a fish tank which is generally composed of various types of fish, a classroom is also composed of various types of students.
				Prof. Udit shared an interesting example of comparing different types of fish with different types of students in the classroom. 
				There will be usually trouble-making students like the "Piranha fish". These students are hard to manage and create problems during the class.
				The next category of students is those who are good and go without the flow of the entire class. 
				</p></div>
            </div>
			
			This kind of student can
				be compared with the "Catfish". The final category of students is similar to "Goldfish" which everyone likes to have. This group of 
				students are highly motivated and the teacher wishes to have "Goldfish" types of students in the class. But in reality this never happens and
				generally, a class is composed of all three kinds of students. The teacher must handle all three kinds of students according 
				to their nature and make the other two groups of students as "Goldfish".
			
			<h4 class="mb-3 mt-5">Building Leadership Qualities</h4>
			
			
			<div class="about-author d-flex p-4 bg-light">
              <div class="bio mr-5">

              <div class="desc" style="width:3800px">
                <p> Leadership qualities required for an academic were discussed by Prof. Nagalingam Nagendrakumar. 
				He is an Associate Dean, attached to the Business School of SLIIT. 
				The discussion was centered on the key leadership skills that we should poses as an academic including the ability to empower others,
				motivating a set of groups to achieve a goal, nurturing and enhancing the surroundings, and careful influence on others.
				Also, he highlighted that it is important that we convey messages positively as a leader to maintain good relationships in our working environment.
				Further, it was discussed that as a leader, careful use of power, understanding and inspiring others and, our behaviors are too important to become a successful leader.
				</p></div>
            </div>
			
			Finally, we analyzed different kinds of leaders, as well mapping our leadership skills with the existing leader types.
				With this analysis, I could notice that I pose behaviors of multiple types of leaders including Decisiveness. 
				For example, being supportive as a "Coach", being strategic as a "Visionary Leader", having self-confidence as an "Autocratic Leader" etc.
				This is self-analysis was helpful in understanding what kind of leaders we are and how can the other skills can be improved.
			
			<h4 class="mb-3 mt-5">Motivation of Students</h4>
			
			<div class="about-author d-flex p-4 bg-light">
              <div class="bio mr-5">
                <img src="images/motivation_types.jpg" alt="Image placeholder" class="img-fluid mb-4">

              <div class="desc" style="width:2300px">
                <p> Motivating students is one of the key factors for successful learning. This valuable session was conducted by Prof. Udit Jayasinghe.
				The initial discussions were oriented on analyzing different strategies that we use to motivate the students during the class. 
				A bunch of techniques was proposed by the entire class including, giving positive feedback, offering rewards, keeping positive competitions,
				giving students responsibility, teamwork, setting achievable goals, expressing our interest in their growth, and sharing success stories.
				
				</p></div>
            </div>
			
			The main takeaway of the discussion was, there are two types of motivations, extrinsic and intrinsic, which are controlled by the external 
				and internal factors respectively. So we must achieve both while motivating the students. Prof. Udit further highlighted,
				the behavior of the teacher, structure of the course, our assessing methods, our information interactions with the students, and our
				teaching styles, all affect the motivation of the students. Therefore we must focus on improving these five key aspects
				to motivate the students for better learning.

                <p> In any profession, maintaining our portfolio is important to showcase our talents and achievements for greater opportunities.
				Especially, as an academic it is a key factor for our career growth and self-reflection on what we have done, what we are doing and
				what we want to do. This important session was carried out by Prof. Sriyani Peiris, who is serving as the Head of Science and Education 
				department, Faculty of Humanities at SLIIT. Her 31+ years of service to the Agriculture higher education of Sri Lanka itself indicates
				that no better person can discuss maintaining a portfolio for a successful carrier path. 
				She mainly highlighted that there are different kinds of portfolios, personal, career, employment, and assessment and it is important that we
			maintain our career portfolio to highlight our skills and abilities.
				</p></div>
            </div>
			
			 This portfolio should reflect PEAKS, Personal characteristics, Experience
			Accomplishments, Knowledge, and Skills. Also, we must reflect on our portfolio by analyzing it often to learn from our portfolio,

                <p> With the advancement of technology, it is easy and important to include innovative teaching techniques to keep the students focused and motivated.
				This interesting session was conducted by Prof. Udit Jayasinghe. He highlighted the necessity for choosing innovative techniques to support the 
				outcome-based education. This is to make sure that the techniques enable student-centered learning instead of the teacher dominating as in the traditional learning approach.
				Further, these techniques should match with the behavior of the teacher, the structure of the course, and the assessment methods used.
				Moreover, while choosing the technology, three main domains of learning Cognitive, Psychomotor, and Affective are to be considered.
				
				</p></div>
            </div>
			 
				
			Prof. Udit Jayasinghe shared a wide range of techniques he used successfully during his teaching with examples. 
				This includes using mindmap for summarizing the lectures, "Z" to "A" approach, where we show the students first and then explain, 
				having guest speakers even from final year and graduated students, doing demonstrations. 
				Further, he showed, using case studies as a tool of teaching enabled him to introduce a Symposium for students to publish their writings.
				Apart from that, activities such as brainstorming, group discussions, role-playing, debates, poster presentations, and field exposure 
				affective too. Also, he highlighted the need of having more research and practical work for the 3rd year and 4th year students who are supposed to 
				poses higher-order thinking skills compare to the 1st and 2nd-year students.

			  <h5>Outcome-based Education (OBE)</h5>
                <p> OBE is based on the idea of "Success for all the learners" or "Employability for all the learners". 
				OBE makes sure that the entire learning process of a student ensures employability at the time of graduation. 
				One important practice of OBE is student-centered learning where the delivery of the session is centered on the student instead of the teacher dominating the class.
				Further, there are four key principles of OBE, setting clear learning outcomes, designing down approach, expanding the opportunity and 
				finally high expectation of success.

			  <h5>Curriculum Development</h5>
                <p> The curriculum indicates the pathway of a student in achieving his or her goals.
				Developing the curriculum to ensure success for all learners is an important principle of Outcome-based education.
				There are certain key factors to be considered while developing the curriculum for OBE. 
				</p></div>
            </div>
			
			The underlying principle behind curriculum development is 
				aligning it with the learning outcome of the program and the support the graduate profile that specifies the abilities that the student is
				expected to have developed by the end of the study program. This demands the revision of the curriculum according to the change in
				graduate profile to cater to the need or gap of a new working environment at the time of graduation. Further, the development of the revision of
				the curriculum should be carried out in design down manner, where the final year modules learning outcome should support the program 
				learning outcome as well as the graduate profile. Modules delivered in other years should have learning outcomes set to support the 
				the learning outcome of the modules taught in the following years.

                <p> Reflective practice is the process of taking opportunities to think about yourself. It is very important that we look inwards
				and analyze the consequences as well plan the future according. Prof. B.M.K. Perera started this session with explaning how our brain 
				works and the responsibilities of each component of the brain. An interesting region of the brain called Default Mode Network, which
				is activated when we do not do critical thinking. Also this region deals with the emotions. Understanding how human brain works
enables us to support the reflective practice. Starting from a session that we deliver to our students to any personal and professional actions of 
ours, it is important that we reflect on by analysing, learning and acting according.

              <div class="desc" style="width:700px">
                <p> Stress is a biological response of the body to external stimulations. 
				While it can support the performance of a person up to some level, extreme levels of stress can lead to exhaustion, Ill-health, and breakout.
				This could also cause many other diseases such as kidney damage, an increase in sugar level, etc.
				Therefore, it is important to manage our stress to maintain our well-being. 
				This sensitive topic was discussed by Dr. B.M.K Perara, where we got the chance to evaluate our stress level by quantifying different qualities of ours out of 10.
				</p></div>
            </div>
			
			Further, he explained four different types of stress, Eustress, Distress, Acute stress, and Chronic stress. 
				These types vary based on the amount of stress and the time period it lasts. 
				Except for Eustress which is a small amount of stress we experience for a short time, the other three categories require attention and care at the right time.
				Further, he discussed various strategies to overcome stress at the workplace as well in our personal life. 
				Some key strategies that I could easily apply are, accepting limits, setting achievable goals, breaks from work life, and focusing on good qualities.

                <p> The major takeaway from this interesting session was "Time is the most valuable thing that someone could offer to you". 
				Managing time is key for the success of any activity. We were lucky to have Dr. Jayalath Edirisinghe as the resource person for this key topic.
				He is a senior lecturer attached to the Faculty of Civil Engineering, University of Peradeniya. 
				
				</p></div>
            </div>
			
			Dr. Jayalath shared many experiences of him to highlight the importance of time management.
				Also, he highlighted that the time cannot be managed by us, where we can manage ourselves to manage the time. 
				Various factors such as misuse of technology, unclear objectives, interruptions, stress, too many works at a time, etc. could lead to poor time management.
				Therefore, it is important to set Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-based goals.
